# Vorto
a neovim config for writers

Inspired by - and largely stolen from - [OVIWrite](https://github.com/MiragianCycle/OVIWrite)

## Requirements
 - [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#linux)
 - [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux)
 - [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?tab=readme-ov-file#manual)
   - Might also need [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)to build it
 - [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#building)
   - Might also need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build it
 - [Your favorite Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
 - If you're on linux, you'll need some essential stuff like `cURL` (`sudo apt install curl`)
